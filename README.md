This is a collection of Lua files to help me teach people how to get started with lua.

The .repl file is used to immediately run the code in Repl.it, this may be deleted if you are not using Repl.

To change which file is run in Repl.it follow the following steps:

Step 1: Go to the file .replit

Step 2: Navigate to line 2: run = "lua Basics.lua"#

Step 3: Change the word Basics to the name of your file e.g. lua FizzBuzz.lua
